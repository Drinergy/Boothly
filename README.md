## Technical Details

### Backend (Laravel)
- **PhotoboothController**: Handles photo capture, storage, and collage creation
- **Image Processing**: Uses PHP's GD library for collage generation
- **File Storage**: Photos and collages stored in `storage/app/public/`
- **Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for capture, collage creation, and download

### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)
- **Camera API**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for camera access
- **Canvas Processing**: Captures video frames to canvas for photo processing
- **AJAX Requests**: Communicates with Laravel backend via fetch API
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts

### Collage Features
- **Instax Styling**: White borders with extra space at bottom
- **Photo Numbering**: Each photo numbered in sequence
- **Shadows**: Subtle drop shadows for depth
- **Title & Date**: Automatic title and timestamp
- **Flexible Layout**: Adapts to different photo counts

## File Structure

```

## Customization

### Styling
- Edit `resources/views/photobooth/index.blade.php` to modify the UI
- Adjust CSS variables for colors, spacing, and animations
- Modify the gradient backgrounds and button styles

### Collage Layout

- Adjust photo dimensions, borders, and spacing
- Customize title, fonts, and positioning

### Photo Limits

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 53+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 12+

**Note**: Camera access requires HTTPS in production environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure browser has camera permissions
- Check if camera is being used by another application
- Try refreshing the page
- Use HTTPS in production

### Photos Not Saving
- Check storage directory permissions
- Ensure `storage:link` command was run
- Verify GD extension is installed

### Collage Generation Issues
- Confirm GD extension is enabled
- Check PHP memory limits for large images
- Verify write permissions on storage directories

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all photo uploads
- File type restrictions (PNG only)
- Session-based photo organization
- Automatic cleanup of old files (implement as needed)
